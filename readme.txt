== Description ==
**Control your Shelly devices** from your WordPress site.

Automatically **import your devices** and you can **turn on, turn off** and see their **consumption.**
You can make it so that you or other users can access Shelly devices from a WordPress installation protected by CMS authentication and **limiting the role of the users**.
It is possible to assign permissions according to the user role to manage the devices in the admin menu.

It is also possible to manage **Shelly devices from the front** and control which user roles can do it.

Use **shortcode** `[mcisc_devices]` **to display devices** on any WordPress page.
